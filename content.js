// Select all variant elements.

// Loop foreach variant image elements.
  // Click each item to force the image to be loaded.

  // If this is the last item in the list, click on the first one to go back to the initial state.

  // This will also distract the user to look at the early variants first while the later one are loading their images.

// End the operation. This is pretty much it.
